# Scaling Relational Graph Convolutional Network training with Graph Summaries and Entity Embedding transfer

This repositor contains the implmentation to scale Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN) trianing with graph summaries, proposed in my thesis.
By training R-GCN on graph summaries entity embeddings are learned.
Training on multiple graph summaries yield multiple entity embeddings for entities in the summary graphs
The e

#Requirements
We recommend creating a virtual environment, e.g. with conda. Use requirements.txt to install the dependencies:
'''
conda create -n mpqe python=3.7
conda activate mpqe
pip install -r requirements.txt
'''
